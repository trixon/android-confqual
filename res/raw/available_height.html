	<p>
		Specifies a minimum available screen height, in "dp" units at which
		the resource should be used&mdash;defined by the
		<code>&lt;N&gt;</code>
		value. This configuration value will change when the orientation
		changes between landscape and portrait to match the current actual
		height.
	</p>
	<p>
		When your application provides multiple resource directories with
		different values for this configuration, the system uses the one
		closest to (without exceeding) the device's current screen height. The
		value here takes into account screen decorations, so if the device has
		some persistent UI elements on the top or bottom edge of the display,
		it uses a value for the height that is smaller than the real screen
		size, accounting for these UI elements and reducing the application's
		available space. Screen decorations that are not fixed (such as a
		phone status bar that can be hidden when full screen) are <em>not</em>
		accounted for here, nor are window decorations like the title bar or
		action bar, so applications must be prepared to deal with a somewhat
		smaller space than they specify.
