	<p>
		Specifies a minimum available screen width, in
		<code>dp</code>
		units at which the resource should be used&mdash;defined by the
		<code>&lt;N&gt;</code>
		value. This configuration value will change when the orientation
		changes between landscape and portrait to match the current actual
		width.
	</p>
	<p>When your application provides multiple resource directories
		with different values for this configuration, the system uses the one
		closest to (without exceeding) the device's current screen width. The
		value here takes into account screen decorations, so if the device has
		some persistent UI elements on the left or right edge of the display,
		it uses a value for the width that is smaller than the real screen
		size, accounting for these UI elements and reducing the application's
		available space.</p>
