		<li><code>ldpi</code>: Low-density screens; approximately 120dpi.</li>
		<li><code>mdpi</code>: Medium-density (on traditional HVGA)
			screens; approximately 160dpi.</li>
		<li><code>hdpi</code>: High-density screens; approximately
			240dpi.</li>
		<li><code>xhdpi</code>: Extra high-density screens; approximately
			320dpi. <em>Added in API Level 8</em></li>
		<li><code>nodpi</code>: This can be used for bitmap resources
			that you do not want to be scaled to match the device density.</li>
		<li><code>tvdpi</code>: Screens somewhere between mdpi and hdpi;
			approximately 213dpi. This is not considered a "primary" density
			group. It is mostly intended for televisions and most apps shouldn't
			need it&mdash;providing mdpi and hdpi resources is sufficient for
			most apps and the system will scale them as appropriate. This
			qualifier was introduced with API level 13.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is a 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between the four primary
		densities (ignoring the tvdpi density). So, a 9x9 bitmap in ldpi is
		12x12 in mdpi, 18x18 in hdpi and 24x24 in xhdpi.</p>
	<p>If you decide that your image resources don't look good enough
		on a television or other certain devices and want to try tvdpi
		resources, the scaling factor is 1.33*mdpi. For example, a 100px x
		100px image for mdpi screens should be 133px x 133px for tvdpi.</p>
	<p class="note">
		<strong>Note:</strong> Using a density qualifier does not imply that
		the resources are <em>only</em> for screens of that density. If you do
		not provide alternative resources with qualifiers that better match
		the current device configuration, the system may use whichever
		resources are the <a href="#BestMatch">best match</a>.

			Multiple Screens</a> for more information about how to handle different
		screen densities and how Android might scale your bitmaps to fit the
		current density.
