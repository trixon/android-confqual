	<p>Almost every application should provide alternative resources to
		support specific device configurations. For instance, you should
		include alternative drawable resources for different screen densities
		and alternative string resources for different languages. At runtime,
		Android detects the current device configuration and loads the
		appropriate resources for your application.</p>

	<p>To specify configuration-specific alternatives for a set of
		resources:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new directory in <code>res/</code> named in the form
			<code>
				<em>&lt;resources_name&gt;</em>-<em>&lt;config_qualifier&gt;</em>
			</code>.
			<ul>
				<li><em><code>&lt;resources_name&gt;</code></em> is the
					directory name of the corresponding default resources.</li>
				<li><em><code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code></em> is a name that
					specifies an individual configuration for which these resources are
					to be used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can append more than one <em><code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code></em>.
				Separate each one with a dash.
			</p>
			<p class="caution">
				<strong>Caution:</strong> When appending multiple qualifiers, you
				must place them in the same order in which they are listed. If the
				qualifiers are ordered wrong, the resources are ignored.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Save the respective alternative resources in this new
			directory. The resource files must be named exactly the same as the
			default resource files.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>For example, here are some default and alternative resources:</p>

	<pre class="classic no-pretty-print">
res/</br>
&nbsp;drawable/</br>   <span style="color: black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;icon.png</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background.png</br>    </span>
&nbsp;drawable-hdpi/</br>  <span style="color: black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;icon.png</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background.png</br>  </span>
</pre>

	<p>
		The
		<code>hdpi</code>
		qualifier indicates that the resources in that directory are for
		devices with a high-density screen. The images in each of these
		drawable directories are sized for a specific screen density, but the
		filenames are exactly the same. This way, the resource ID that you use
		to reference the
		<code>icon.png</code>
		or
		<code>background.png</code>
		image is always the same, but Android selects the version of each
		resource that best matches the current device, by comparing the device
		configuration information with the qualifiers in the resource
		directory name.
	</p>

	<p>Android supports several configuration qualifiers and you can
		add multiple qualifiers to one directory name, by separating each
		qualifier with a dash. The list contains the valid configuration
		qualifiers, in order of precedence&mdash;if you use multiple
		qualifiers for a resource directory, you must add them to the
		directory name in the order they are listed.</p>
