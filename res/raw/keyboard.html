	<ul class="nolist">
		<li><code>keysexposed</code>: Device has a keyboard available. If
			the device has a software keyboard enabled (which is likely), this
			may be used even when the hardware keyboard is <em>not</em> exposed
			to the user, even if the device has no hardware keyboard. If no
			software keyboard is provided or it's disabled, then this is only
			used when a hardware keyboard is exposed.</li>
		<li><code>keyshidden</code>: Device has a hardware keyboard
			available but it is hidden <em>and</em> the device does <em>not</em>
			have a software keyboard enabled.</li>
		<li><code>keyssoft</code>: Device has a software keyboard
			enabled, whether it's visible or not.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you provide
		<code>keysexposed</code>
		resources, but not
		<code>keyssoft</code>
		resources, the system uses the
		<code>keysexposed</code>
		resources regardless of whether a keyboard is visible, as long as the
		system has a software keyboard enabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		This can change during the life of your application if the user opens
		a hardware keyboard. See <a href="runtime-changes.html">Handling
			Runtime Changes</a> for information about how this affects your
		application during runtime.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also see the configuration fields
		<code>
			<a

		</code>
		and
		<code>
			<a
				href="/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#keyboardHidden">keyboardHidden</a>
		</code>
		, which indicate the visibility of a hardware keyboard and and the
		visibility of any kind of keyboard (including software), respectively.
