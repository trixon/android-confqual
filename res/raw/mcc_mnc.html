		The mobile country code (MCC), optionally followed by mobile network
		code (MNC) from the SIM card in the device. For example,
		<code>mcc310</code>
		is U.S. on any carrier,
		<code>mcc310-mnc004</code>
		is U.S. on Verizon, and
		<code>mcc208-mnc00</code>
		is France on Orange.
	</p>
	<p>If the device uses a radio connection (GSM phone), the MCC and
		MNC values come from the SIM card.</p>
	<p>
		You can also use the MCC alone (for example, to include
		country-specific legal resources in your application). If you need to
		specify based on the language only, then use the <em>language and
			region</em> qualifier instead (discussed next). If you decide to use the
		MCC and MNC qualifier, you should do so with care and test that it
		works as expected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also see the configuration fields
		<code>
			<a href="/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#mcc">mcc</a>
		</code>
		, and
		<code>
			<a href="/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#mnc">mnc</a>
		</code>
		, which indicate the current mobile country code and mobile network
		code, respectively.
