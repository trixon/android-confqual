		<li><code>small</code>: Screens that are of similar size to a
			low-density QVGA screen. The minimum layout size for a small screen
			is approximately 320x426 dp units. Examples are QVGA low density and
			VGA high density.</li>
		<li><code>normal</code>: Screens that are of similar size to a
			medium-density HVGA screen. The minimum layout size for a normal
			screen is approximately 320x470 dp units. Examples of such screens a
			WQVGA low density, HVGA medium density, WVGA high density.</li>
		<li><code>large</code>: Screens that are of similar size to a
			medium-density VGA screen. The minimum layout size for a large screen
			is approximately 480x640 dp units. Examples are VGA and WVGA medium
			density screens.</li>
		<li><code>xlarge</code>: Screens that are considerably larger
			than the traditional medium-density HVGA screen. The minimum layout
			size for an xlarge screen is approximately 720x960 dp units. In most
			cases, devices with extra large screens would be too large to carry
			in a pocket and would most likely be tablet-style devices. <em>Added

	<p class="note">
		<strong>Note:</strong> Using a size qualifier does not imply that the
		resources are <em>only</em> for screens of that size. If you do not
		provide alternative resources with qualifiers that better match the
		current device configuration, the system may use whichever resources
		are the <a href="#BestMatch">best match</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="caution">
		<strong>Caution:</strong> If all your resources use a size qualifier
		that is <em>larger</em> than the current screen, the system will <strong>not</strong>
		use them and your application will crash at runtime (for example, if
		all layout resources are tagged with the
		<code>xlarge</code>
		qualifier, but the device is a normal-size screen).
