		The fundamental size of a screen, as indicated by the shortest
		dimension of the available screen area. Specifically, the device's
		smallestWidth is the shortest of the screen's available height and
		width (you may also think of it as the "smallest possible width" for
		the screen). You can use this qualifier to ensure that, regardless of
		the screen's current orientation, your application's has at least
		<code>&lt;N&gt;</code>
		dps of width available for it UI.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if your layout requires that its smallest dimension of
		screen area be at least 600 dp at all times, then you can use this
		qualifer to create the layout resources,
		<code>res/layout-sw600dp/</code>
		. The system will use these resources only when the smallest dimension
		of available screen is at least 600dp, regardless of whether the 600dp
		side is the user-perceived height or width. The smallestWidth is a
		fixed screen size characteristic of the device; <strong>the
			device's smallestWidth does not change when the screen's orientation
			changes</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The smallestWidth of a device takes into account screen decorations
		and system UI. For example, if the device has some persistent UI
		elements on the screen that account for space along the axis of the
		smallestWidth, the system declares the smallestWidth to be smaller
		than the actual screen size, because those are screen pixels not
		available for your UI. Thus, the value you use should be the actual
		smallest dimension <em>required by your layout</em> (usually, this
		value is the "smallest width" that your layout supports, regardless of
		the screen's current orientation).
	</p>
	<p>Some values you might use here for common screen sizes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>320, for devices with screen configurations such as:
			<ul>
				<li>240x320 ldpi (QVGA handset)</li>
				<li>320x480 mdpi (handset)</li>
				<li>480x800 hdpi (high density handset)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>480, for screens such as 480x800 mdpi (tablet/handset).</li>
		<li>600, for screens such as 600x1024 mdpi (7" tablet).</li>
		<li>720, for screens such as 720x1280 mdpi (10" tablet).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When your application provides multiple resource directories
		with different values for the smallestWidth qualifier, the system uses
		the one closest to (without exceeding) the device's smallestWidth.</p>

		Also see the <a
			href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#requiresSmallest"><code>android:requiresSmallestWidthDp</code></a>
		attribute, which declares the minimum smallestWidth with which your
		application is compatible, and the
		<code>
			<a
				href="/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#smallestScreenWidthDp">smallestScreenWidthDp</a>
		</code>
		configuration field, which holds the device's smallestWidth value.
